              and Clouds.

            <h3>Internet Computer: Where We're Going, We Don't Need Clouds</h3>
            <p>
              The Internet Computer is something between a blockchain and a
              decentralized cloud provider. Ambitiously, it's taking on all of
              Web 2.0.
            </p>
            <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
            <p>
              The grandly-named Internet Computer is, at first glance, something
              between a blockchain and a decentralized cloud provider. It's run
              by the DFINITY Foundation, a Swiss not-for-profit organization.
              Since launching last May, Dfinity has made some big claims about
              what the Internet Computer is capable of in the emerging Web3
              world ‚Äî it's being pitched as ‚Äúbuild almost anything, dApps
              without cloud.‚Äù So to find out more, I spoke with Lomesh Dutta,
              Vice President of Growth at the DFINITY Foundation.
            </p>
            <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
            <p>
              First, let's get our heads around what the Internet Computer is.
              In a primer published last year, Dfinity founder Dominic Williams
              called the Internet Computer an ‚Äúinfinite blockchain‚Äù and said it
              was ‚Äúthe third great innovation in blockchain,‚Äù after Bitcoin's
              cryptocurrency in 2009 and Ethereum's smart contracts in 2015.
              Now, clearly we need to be careful about hyperbole in the crypto
              world. So, to translate what Williams is saying into practical web
              architecture language: the Internet Computer is made up of
              independent data centers that cooperate with each other (thanks to
              a Redditor for that definition). I'm not sure why this makes it
              ‚Äúinfinite,‚Äù but I guess the point is it's a peer-to-peer network
              and not one owned by a corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our conversation, Lomesh Dutta defined the Internet Computer as
              ‚Äúessentially a network of interconnected blockchains.‚Äù These are
              called ‚Äúsubnets‚Äù in Dfinity's terminology. In its documentation,
              Dfinity states that ‚Äúeach subnet is a blockchain that consists of
              some number of decentralized, independently owned and controlled
              machines ‚Äî connected peer computers called nodes ‚Äî that run the
              software components of the Internet Computer protocol.‚Äù This means
              that each of these subnet blockchains is capable of running web
              applications.
            </p>
            <h3>How Internet Computer Compares to Ethereum</h3>
            <p>
              So how does all this compare to Ethereum, the current leading web
              development platform for blockchain? The key difference is that
              Internet Computer apps are run fully ‚Äúon-chain,‚Äù whereas with
              Ethereum it's common to put only transaction data on the
              blockchain. Since Ethereum is basically one giant blockchain, it's
              terribly inefficient as an application platform. So it relies
              heavily on ‚Äúoff-chain‚Äù solutions and decentralized storage
              services. But with the Internet Computer, said Dutta, everything
              can be done on its subnets. You can essentially connect one
              blockchain to another,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúso we have a way in which all of
              these blockchains can communicate with each other.
